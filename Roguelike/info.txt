Challenge Requirements
---
1 Hero character who moves up/down/left/right in a box map.
Map must have boundary elements to contain it -- Walls/Water/Moutains/Whatever you come up with
Hero does not have to be a person. Could be a spaceship/sea creature/whatever - Just has to move up/down/left/right on a 2-D map
Map has to be 20x20. The boundary are some element which prevents passage like a wall, water or blackholes. Whatever fits your theme.
Your hero has 100 movement points. Each time they move up/down/left/right they lose 1 movement points. When they reach 0 movement points the game ends.
Random elements are generated in the room. Gold. Treasure. Plants. Towns. Caves. Whatever. When the hero reaches that point they score a point. You must have 100 random elements.
At the end of the game when your hero is out of movement. The score is based on how many elements you are able to move to. The higher the score the better.
Hero starts either in a fixed room spot or random spot. I leave it to you to decide.
