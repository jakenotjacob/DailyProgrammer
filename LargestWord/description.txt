Given a string of words and a string of letters. Find the largest string(s)
that are in the 1st string of words that can be formed from the letters in the
2nd string.

Letters can be only used once. So if the string has "a b c" then words like
"aaa" and "bbb" do not work because there is only 1 "a" or "b" to be used.
If you have tie for the longest strings then output all the possible strings.
If you find no words at all then output "No Words Found"

Input:
(String of words)
(String of characters)



EX:
- in
abc cca aaaaaa bca
a b c
- out
bc bca
